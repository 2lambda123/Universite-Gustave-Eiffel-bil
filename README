Building requirements
---------------------

Building Bil from source requires:
  Make (http://www.gnu.org/software/make)
  C and C++ compilers (http://gcc.gnu.org)
  Fortran compiler (http://gcc.gnu.org/fortran)

Building the documentation from source requires:
  Texinfo (http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo)
  Doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen)


List of folders
---------------

	./base      reference solution and data bases
	./bin       binaries
	./doc       documentations
	./examples  examples of input data files
	./src       sources
	./lib       libraries


Building and Installation
-------------------------

To build Bil and/or the documentation, use the following commands:

	make      (build the binary file bil and the documentation)
	make bin  (build the binary file only)
	make doc  (build the documentation only)

The binary file is created in the folder ./bin, the documentation (files info, ps, pdf, txt, html) is created in ./doc.

To install Bil, use the following commands (this may require root permissions):

	make install      (install the binary and the documentation)
	make install-bin  (install the binary only)
	make install-doc  (install the documentation only)

By default the files are installed in PREFIX = /usr/local

	bil       PREFIX/bin
	bil.1     PREFIX/man/man1
	bil.info  PREFIX/info

PREFIX is defined in "Makefile". Unless essential it is not recommended to change the location PREFIX. If however you want another location, change the variable PREFIX in "Makefile" and  run "make" again. If you don't have root permissions use an alias instead (i.e. enter anywhere: alias bil='absolutepathtobilfolder/bin/bil-I.J').

Once installation is completed, running 

	make clean

will delete all the local files previously created.


Usage
-----
The bil program prints out the available options when run without any
option. To run a specific job, you can enter

	bil [options] myfile
