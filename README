Program
-------

Bil is a modeling platform based on finite volume/element methods. 

Bil is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GnuGPL). 

Bil can be downloaded from the URL 

	https://github.com/ifsttar/bil


Building requirements
---------------------

Building Bil from source requires:
  Make (http://www.gnu.org/software/make)
  C and C++ compilers (http://gcc.gnu.org)
  Fortran compiler (http://gcc.gnu.org/fortran)

Building the documentation from source requires:
  Texinfo (http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo)
  Doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen)


List of folders
---------------

	./base      reference solution and data bases
	./bin       binaries
	./doc       documentations
	./examples  examples of input data files
	./src       sources
	./lib       libraries


Building and Installation
-------------------------

To build Bil and/or the documentation, use the following commands:

	make      (build the binary file bil and the documentation)
	make bin  (build the binary file only)
	make doc  (build the documentation only)

The binary file is created in the folder ./bin, the documentation (files info, ps, pdf, txt, html) is created in ./doc.

To install Bil, use the following commands (this may require root permissions):

	make install      (install the binary and the documentation)
	make install-bin  (install the binary only)
	make install-doc  (install the documentation only)

By default the files are installed in PREFIX = /usr/local

	bil       PREFIX/bin
	bil.1     PREFIX/man/man1
	bil.info  PREFIX/info

PREFIX is defined in "Makefile". Unless essential it is not recommended to change the location PREFIX. If however you want another location, change the variable PREFIX in "Makefile" and  run "make" again. If you don't have root permissions use an alias instead (i.e. enter anywhere: alias bil='absolutepathtobilfolder/bin/bil-I.J').

Once installation is completed, running 

	make clean

will delete all the local files previously created.


External libraries
------------------
Some functionalities (like solvers ma38 and superlu) require the use of the following libraries:
BLAS     -  this library is usually supplied by your computer processor vendor,
            and using a good one is critical to performance.
            If you are unable to locate a vendor BLAS then you should use either
            the GotoBLAS, OpenBLAS or ATLAS BLAS (the latter is often available 
            as part of your linux distribution). If you cannot gain access to any 
            of these, you can obtain the relevant BLAS routines by visiting the 
            following URL: http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/blas/
            Such routines obtained from the above url are at least ten times
            slower than the other BLAS libraries mentioned.
LAPACK   -  You can obtain the latest LAPACK from http://www.netlib.org/lapack
SUPERLU  -  You can obtain the relevant C functions by visiting the following
            URL: https://github.com/xiaoyeli/superlu

These librairies are not included in this package. You need to explicitly specify their location in the file "make.extralibs". You can also choose to disable the use of these libraries and the associated functionalities.


External software
-----------------
This package contains some fortran routines provided by HSL:
"HSL, a collection of Fortran codes for large-scale scientific computation. See http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/"


Usage
-----
The bil program prints out the available options when run without any
option. To run a specific job, you can enter

	bil [options] myfile
