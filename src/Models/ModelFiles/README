Instructions for compatibility of versions
------------------------------------------

Models under bil-1.x still work under bil-2.0 without major recoding providing two small changes as described in the following.

1. Substitute the 2 code lines

    #include "../defs.h"
    #include "../lib.h"

    with

    #include "model.h"

2. Add 2 more code lines of the form

    #define MODELINDEX  99
    #include "OldMethods.h"

    Replace 99 by the actual index used for the model.

See examples in this directory.
